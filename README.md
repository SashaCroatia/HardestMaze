## Project Template: AI Algorithm Comparison

This repository serves as the template for your course project. Below is a guide to the structure of the project and the purpose of each file. As you progress, you should add details about your specific project (e.g., "This file contains the implementations of the X, Y, and Z algorithms"). 

---

## Repository Structure
The repository includes the following files:

### 1. `algorithms.py`  
This file will contain the implementations of the AI algorithms/agents used in your project.  
- Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining each algorithm.

### 2. `comparisons.py`  
This file will contain the code for performing comparisons between your selected algorithms.  
- The file should be designed to perform **all comparisons** when executed.  
- **Optional Feature:** Include a setting to run a subset of comparisons for testing purposes.  

### 3. `demo.py`  
This file will provide a brief demonstration of your project.  

#### Requirements:
- **Progress Report:** Demonstrate *selected agents* attempting to solve each problem.  
- **Final Report:** Demonstrate *each algorithm* attempting to solve each problem.  

#### Guidelines for Demonstrations:
Keep the demonstrations concise but meaningful to highlight key behaviors.

### 4. `problems.py`  
This file will contain the implementation of the problems you are solving with your AI algorithms.  
- Ensure that the problems are clearly defined and modular, so the algorithms can be easily tested on each.  
- For the **progress report**, this file should be fully implemented and require no major edits afterward.

## Instructions for Students

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:  
```
git clone <your_repo>
```

### Step 2: Code Your Project
- Implement your algorithms in [`algorithms.py`](./algorithms.py).
- Define your problems in [`problems.py`](./problems.py).
- Write the comparison logic in [`comparisons.py`](./comparisons.py).
- Create the demonstrations in [`demo.py`](./demo.py).

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Project Instructions](./project_instructions.md).

### Step 3: Commit Regularly
- Ensure at least 10 commits are made before the progress report submission deadline.
- Make detailed commit messages describing what was added or changed.
